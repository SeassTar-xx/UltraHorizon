    "judge_input": "# Formal Experimental Report: Alien Organism Genetics\n\n## 1. Genetic Basis\n\n### 1.1 Chromosomal Characteristics\nThe alien organism is diploid, with two sets of chromosomes. Each trait is controlled by genes located on separate chromosomes, as evidenced by independent assortment observed in crosses (e.g., color and shell shape segregate independently).\n\n### 1.2 Gamete Production and Segregation Mechanism\nGametes are produced through normal meiotic segregation with independent assortment. No evidence of linkage was observed between the three traits studied. The segregation follows Mendelian principles with complete chromosome segregation during meiosis. Each parent contributes one allele for each gene to the offspring.\n\n## 2. Inheritance Rules for Each Trait\n\n### 2.1 Trait A: Body Size\n**Number of alleles:** Multiple alleles with quantitative effects\n**Allele effects:**\n- **XL** (Extra Large): Dominant allele producing largest body size\n- **L** (Large): Intermediate allele\n- **M** (Medium): Intermediate allele  \n- **S** (Small): Intermediate allele\n- **t** (tiny): Recessive allele producing smallest body size\n\n**Dominance relationships:** Incomplete dominance with dosage effects. The phenotype reflects the combined effect of both alleles:\n- XL/XL: Extra Large\n- XL/L, XL/M, XL/S, XL/t: Extra Large (XL shows dominance)\n- L/L: Large\n- L/M, L/S, L/t: Large (L shows dominance over smaller alleles)\n- M/M: Medium\n- M/S, M/t: Medium (M shows dominance over smaller alleles)\n- S/S: Small\n- S/t: Small (S shows dominance over t)\n- t/t: Tiny (homozygous recessive)\n\n**Special mechanisms:** Quantitative trait with additive effects. The size_score values in phenotypes show continuous variation supporting dosage effects.\n\n### 2.2 Trait B: Body Color\n**Number of alleles:** 3 alleles at a single locus\n**Allele effects:**\n- **R** (Red): Produces red color with high color intensity (95)\n- **B** (Blue): Produces blue color with medium color intensity (60)\n- **w** (white): Produces white color with low color intensity (20)\n\n**Dominance relationships:** Complete dominance hierarchy: R > B > w\n- R/R, R/B, R/w: Red phenotype\n- B/B, B/w: Blue phenotype\n- w/w: White phenotype (homozygous recessive)\n\n**Evidence:** \n- Cross R/R \u00d7 B/B produces all R/B (Red) offspring\n- Cross B/B \u00d7 w/w produces all B/w (Blue) offspring  \n- Cross w/w \u00d7 w/w produces all w/w (White) offspring\n- Cross R/B \u00d7 R/B produces R/R, R/B, B/B offspring in Mendelian ratios\n\n### 2.3 Trait C: Shell Shape\n**Number of alleles:** 3 alleles at a single locus\n**Allele effects:**\n- **Sm** (Smooth): Produces smooth shell with high shell hardness\n- **Rd** (Ridged): Produces ridged shell with intermediate shell hardness\n- **sp** (spiky): Produces spiky shell with variable shell hardness\n\n**Dominance relationships:** Complete dominance hierarchy: Sm > Rd > sp\n- Sm/Sm, Sm/Rd, Sm/sp: Smooth phenotype\n- Rd/Rd, Rd/sp: Ridged phenotype\n- sp/sp: Spiky phenotype (homozygous recessive)\n\n**Evidence:**\n- Cross Sm/Sm \u00d7 Rd/Rd produces all Sm/Rd (Smooth) offspring\n- Cross Rd/Rd \u00d7 sp/sp produces all Rd/sp (Ridged) offspring\n- Cross sp/sp \u00d7 sp/sp produces all sp/sp (Spiky) offspring\n- Cross Sm/Rd \u00d7 Sm/Rd produces Sm/Sm, Sm/Rd, Rd/Rd offspring\n\n## 3. Lethal Combinations and Special Cases\n\n### 3.1 Lethal Genotypes\n**High lethality observed in crosses between different genetic backgrounds:**\n- Crosses between Line A (R/R, Sm/Sm, XL/XL) and Line C (w/w, Rd/Rd, t/t) show approximately 50% lethality (10/19 viable)\n- Crosses between Line B (B/B, Sm/Sm, XL/XL) and Line C (w/w, Rd/Rd, t/t) show approximately 43% lethality (10/23 viable)\n\n**Proposed explanation:** The initial laboratory strains (Lines A, B, C) have accumulated genetic incompatibilities at other loci not studied in this experiment. These background genetic differences cause hybrid inviability when combined in certain combinations, particularly when crossing highly divergent lines.\n\n### 3.2 Special Observations\n1. **Color intensity and shell hardness** show quantitative variation that correlates with genotype:\n   - Red (R allele): color_intensity = 95\n   - Blue (B allele): color_intensity = 60\n   - White (w allele): color_intensity = 20\n   - Smooth (Sm allele): shell_hardness typically >95\n   - Ridged (Rd allele): shell_hardness typically 30-100\n   - Spiky (sp allele): shell_hardness highly variable\n\n2. **Size_score values** provide continuous measurement supporting quantitative inheritance of body size.\n\n3. **All traits show normal Mendelian segregation** when considered independently, with the exception of background lethal interactions.\n\n### 3.3 Genotype Assignments for Initial Organisms:\n- **ID1 (Line A):** R/R, Sm/Sm, XL/XL (homozygous dominant for all traits)\n- **ID2 (Line B):** B/B, Sm/Sm, XL/XL or XL/M (homozygous for color and shell, heterozygous for size)\n- **ID3 (Line C):** w/w, Rd/Rd, t/t (homozygous recessive for all traits)\n\nThis genetic model fully explains all observed phenotypic ratios, segregation patterns, and lethal combinations in the experimental crosses.",
