Initial organisms: ID1 - extra_large red spiky, ID2 - extra_large blue smooth, ID3 - tiny white ridged. Need to start crosses to understand inheritance patterns.
Cross 1x2: All offspring extra_large red spiky. 10 viable out of 19 attempts (9 lethal). Red appears dominant over blue. Spiky dominant over smooth. Extra_large appears dominant. Lethality suggests some genotype combinations are non-viable.
Cross 1x3: All offspring red, ridged shell. Body size varies: extra_large, large, small. Red dominant over white. Ridged appears dominant over spiky? Or maybe intermediate? Need more crosses. Same lethality pattern: 10/19 viable.
Cross 2x3: All offspring blue, smooth shell. Body size varies: extra_large, large, medium, small. Blue dominant over white. Smooth dominant over ridged? Or maybe smooth is dominant to ridged? Different lethality: 10/23 viable (13 lethal).
Cross 4x5 (both red spiky extra_large): All offspring red. Mostly spiky but one smooth (ID39). Body sizes: mostly extra_large, some medium. This suggests segregation of alleles. Smooth reappeared from cross of two spiky parents, so spiky not simply dominant over smooth. Maybe incomplete dominance or multiple alleles.
Cross 14x15 (both red ridged large): Segregation observed! Offspring: red, white, and mixed colors. White reappeared. Shell shape all ridged. Body sizes: large, extra_large, tiny. This shows color alleles segregating. White is recessive to red. Also shows body size variation.
Cross 24x25 (both blue smooth extra_large): All offspring blue smooth. No white segregation. Blue appears homozygous? Or blue dominant over white but white recessive. Body size segregation: extra_large, large, medium, small.
Cross 14x24 (red ridged large x blue smooth extra_large): High lethality (24/34). Offspring colors: blue and red. Shell shapes: smooth, spiky, ridged. Blue appears dominant over red? Or codominance? Shell shape shows all three types: smooth, spiky, ridged. This suggests multiple alleles or complex inheritance for shell shape.
Cross 45x46 (white ridged tiny x red ridged large): Offspring colors: red and white. Shell shapes: mostly ridged, one spiky (ID76). Body sizes: large and tiny. This confirms white is recessive to red. Spiky reappeared from ridged parents, suggesting complex shell inheritance.
Cross 39x40 (red smooth x red spiky): High lethality (16/26). Offspring: red and blue colors! Blue reappeared from red parents. Shell shapes: smooth and spiky. This suggests color inheritance is more complex than simple dominance. Blue allele can be carried by red parents. Maybe red is heterozygous with blue recessive? Or multiple alleles.
Cross 87x88 (blue smooth x red smooth): Offspring: blue and red. All smooth shell. This suggests blue and red alleles segregate. Blue not simply dominant over red - both appear in offspring. Maybe codominance or multiple alleles with red > blue > white hierarchy.
Cross 76x77 (white spiky tiny x red ridged large): Offspring colors: red and white. Shell shapes: ridged and spiky. Body sizes: large and tiny. This shows independent assortment of color and shell shape. White recessive to red confirmed.
Cross 94x95 (blue smooth x red smooth): Offspring: blue and red. All smooth. Consistent with previous. Need to test body size inheritance more systematically.
Self-cross of ID3 (white ridged tiny): All offspring white ridged tiny. This is homozygous recessive for all traits. Confirms white is recessive, ridged may be homozygous, tiny is homozygous.
Self-cross of ID1 (red spiky extra_large): All offspring red spiky extra_large. This suggests ID1 is homozygous for red, spiky, and extra_large. But earlier crosses showed segregation, so maybe not homozygous for all.
Self-cross of ID2 (blue smooth extra_large): All offspring blue smooth. Mostly extra_large, one medium. This suggests ID2 is homozygous for blue and smooth, but heterozygous for body size.
Cross of two white ridged tiny offspring: All offspring white ridged tiny. Confirms homozygous recessive for all traits.
Cross of two red spiky extra_large from self-cross of ID1: All offspring red spiky extra_large. Consistent with homozygous genotype.
Cross of two blue smooth extra_large from self-cross of ID2: All offspring blue smooth. Mostly extra_large, some medium. Consistent with homozygous for blue and smooth, heterozygous for body size.
Cross 154x164 (white ridged tiny x red spiky extra_large): All offspring red ridged. Body sizes: extra_large, large, small. This confirms red dominant over white, ridged dominant over spiky? Or maybe ridged is intermediate between spiky and smooth?
Cross 154x174 (white ridged tiny x blue smooth extra_large): All offspring blue smooth. Body sizes: extra_large, large. Blue dominant over white, smooth dominant over ridged. High lethality (17/27).
Cross 164x174 (red spiky extra_large x blue smooth extra_large): All offspring red spiky. Red appears dominant over blue. Spiky appears dominant over smooth. Low lethality (4/14).
Cross 194x195 (blue smooth extra_large x blue smooth large): All offspring blue. Mostly smooth, one ridged (ID221). Body sizes: extra_large, large, small. Ridged reappeared from smooth parents, suggesting smooth not simply dominant over ridged.
Cross 204x205 (both red spiky extra_large): All offspring red spiky extra_large. Consistent with homozygous genotype.
Cross 221x222 (blue ridged extra_large x blue smooth extra_large): Offspring: blue, both smooth and ridged. Body sizes: extra_large, small. This shows segregation of shell shape alleles. Smooth and ridged appear to be alleles with incomplete dominance or multiple alleles.
Cross 234x235 (both blue smooth extra_large): Offspring: blue, mostly smooth, some ridged. Body sizes: extra_large, medium. This confirms shell shape segregation. Need to analyze patterns systematically.
