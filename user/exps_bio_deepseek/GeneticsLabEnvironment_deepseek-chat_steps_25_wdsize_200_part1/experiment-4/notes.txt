Initial organisms observed: ID1 - extra_large red spiky, ID2 - extra_large blue smooth, ID3 - tiny white ridged. Need to start crosses to understand inheritance patterns. Traits: body_size (extra_large, tiny), body_color (red, blue, white), shell_shape (spiky, smooth, ridged).
Cross 1 (ID1 x ID2): All offspring extra_large red spiky. 10 viable out of 19 attempts (52.6% viability). High lethality (9 lethal). Red appears dominant over blue, spiky dominant over smooth. All offspring extra_large - suggests extra_large dominant or both parents homozygous for extra_large.
Cross 2 (ID1 x ID3): Offspring show variation in body_size: extra_large, large, small. All offspring red (red dominant over white). All offspring ridged (ridged dominant over spiky?). Body_size inheritance appears more complex - not simple dominance. 10/19 viable (52.6% viability again).
Cross 3 (ID2 x ID3): Offspring show body_size variation: extra_large, large, medium, small. All offspring blue (blue dominant over white). All offspring smooth (smooth dominant over ridged). Different shell_shape dominance pattern than cross 2. Viability 10/23 (43.5%).
Cross 4 (ID4 x ID14): Both parents red, but offspring ID43 is blue! This suggests color inheritance is more complex than simple dominance. Shell_shape shows all three types: spiky, ridged, smooth. Body_size mostly extra_large but some small. Very high lethality (23/33).
Cross 5 (ID24 x ID25): Both parents blue smooth extra_large. All offspring blue smooth, but body_size shows variation: extra_large, large, medium, small. This suggests body_size is not simple Mendelian - possibly polygenic or dosage dependent. Viability 10/14 (71.4%).
Cross 6 (ID14 x ID15): Both parents red ridged large. Offspring show white color appearing! ID56, 59, 60 are white. This confirms color inheritance is complex - not simple dominance. Body_size shows extra_large, large, tiny. Shell_shape all ridged. High viability 10/12 (83.3%).
Cross 7 (ID43 x ID44): Both parents blue. Offspring all blue. Shell_shape shows both ridged and smooth. Body_size mostly extra_large with some small. Viability 10/27 (37%). Need to test more crosses to understand inheritance patterns.
Cross 8 (ID56 x ID57): White x red produces all red offspring. Red appears dominant over white. Shell_shape mostly ridged, one spiky. Body_size shows extra_large, large, tiny. Viability 10/18 (55.6%).
Cross 9 (ID59 x ID60): White x white produces all white offspring. Shell_shape all ridged. Body_size shows extra_large and large. Viability 10/25 (40%). This suggests white is recessive to red and blue.
Cross 10 (ID39 x ID40): Red smooth x red spiky produces all red offspring. Shell_shape shows ridged, spiky. Ridged appears frequently. Body_size shows extra_large, large, small. Viability 10/21 (47.6%).
Cross 11 (ID74 x ID75): Red spiky x red ridged produces both red and white offspring. White appears again from red parents. Shell_shape shows spiky and ridged. Body_size shows extra_large and large. Viability 10/21 (47.6%).
Cross 12 (ID84 x ID85): White x white produces all white offspring. Shell_shape shows both spiky and ridged. Body_size shows extra_large and large. Viability 10/18 (55.6%).
Cross 13 (ID104 x ID105): White x red produces both red and white offspring. Shell_shape shows spiky and ridged. Body_size shows extra_large and large. Viability 10/21 (47.6%).
Cross 14 (ID43 x ID56): Blue x white produces both blue and white offspring. Shell_shape mostly ridged, one spiky. Body_size all extra_large. Viability 10/16 (62.5%). This suggests blue and white show incomplete dominance or co-dominance.
Cross 15 (ID1 x ID43): Red x blue produces all red offspring. Red appears dominant over blue. Shell_shape shows ridged and spiky. Body_size mostly extra_large, one medium. Viability 10/28 (35.7%).
Patterns observed: Body_size appears to be quantitative/polygenic with multiple alleles. Color: Red dominant over blue and white, blue dominant over white, but red x red can produce white (suggests recessive alleles). Shell_shape: Complex interactions - spiky dominant over smooth, smooth dominant over ridged, but ridged appears in crosses with spiky x ridged. Need to formulate inheritance rules.
Cross 16 (ID140 x ID141): Blue x blue produces both blue and white offspring. This confirms blue x blue can produce white, similar to red x red producing white. Shell_shape all ridged. Body_size all extra_large. Viability 10/18 (55.6%).
Cross 17 (ID154 x ID155): White x blue produces both white and blue offspring. Shell_shape all ridged. Body_size all extra_large. Viability 10/20 (50%).
Cross 18 (ID138 x ID139): White spiky x white ridged produces all white offspring. Shell_shape shows both spiky and ridged. Body_size all extra_large. Viability 10/18 (55.6%).
Cross 19 (ID176 x ID177): White spiky x white ridged produces all white offspring. Shell_shape shows both spiky and ridged. Body_size mostly extra_large, one large. Viability 10/16 (62.5%).
Cross 20 (ID3 x ID43): White tiny x blue extra_large produces both white and blue offspring. Shell_shape all ridged. Body_size shows tiny, small, large, extra_large. Viability 10/26 (38.5%).
Based on 20 crosses, ready to formulate final report. Key findings: 1) Body_size: quantitative/polygenic with dosage effects. 2) Color: Red > Blue > White dominance hierarchy, but red x red and blue x blue can produce white (recessive alleles). 3) Shell_shape: Spiky > Smooth > Ridged generally, but complex interactions. 4) Viability varies significantly. 5) Likely diploid organisms with normal meiosis.
