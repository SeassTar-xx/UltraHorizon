Initial organisms: ID1 - extra_large red spiky, ID2 - extra_large blue smooth, ID3 - tiny white ridged. Need to start crosses to understand inheritance patterns.
Cross 1x2: All offspring extra_large red spiky. 10 viable out of 19 attempts (9 lethal). Red appears dominant over blue. Spiky dominant over smooth. Extra_large appears dominant. Lethality suggests some genotype combinations are non-viable.
Cross 1x3: All offspring red, ridged shell. Body size varies: extra_large, large, small. Red dominant over white. Ridged appears dominant over spiky? Or maybe intermediate? Need more crosses. Same lethality pattern: 10/19 viable.
Cross 2x3: All offspring blue, smooth shell. Body size varies: extra_large, large, medium, small. Blue dominant over white. Smooth dominant over ridged? Or maybe smooth is dominant to ridged? Different lethality: 10/23 viable (13 lethal).
Cross 4x5 (both red spiky extra_large): Most offspring red spiky extra_large, but one offspring (ID39) has smooth shell! This suggests spiky parents can produce smooth offspring, meaning spiky is not homozygous dominant. Also medium size appears. Need to examine shell shape inheritance more carefully.
Cross 14x15 (both red ridged large): Offspring show segregation! White color appears (ID45, 47, 48). This confirms red is not homozygous in these parents. Also tiny size appears. White color can appear in offspring of red parents, so red is dominant over white. Ridged appears in all offspring.
Cross 24x25 (both blue smooth extra_large): All offspring blue smooth. No white appears, suggesting blue parents might be homozygous for blue? Or blue dominant over white. Smooth appears in all offspring.
Cross 45x47 (both white ridged): Offspring show spiky shell appears! This is important: white ridged parents can produce spiky offspring. So ridged is not homozygous dominant. Shell shape inheritance appears complex - maybe multiple alleles or incomplete dominance.
Cross 39x66 (red smooth x white spiky): Offspring show blue color appears in ID74! This is critical: red x white can produce blue. This suggests color inheritance is not simple dominance but maybe multiple alleles with red > blue > white, or something more complex. Also all offspring spiky.
Cross 74x75 (blue spiky x red spiky): Offspring show all three colors: red, blue, white. This confirms multiple alleles for color. White appears from red x blue cross. Need to determine dominance hierarchy. Also all offspring spiky.
Cross 85x86 (both white spiky): All offspring white spiky. White appears to breed true when both parents are white. This suggests white is recessive to both red and blue.
Cross 89x94 (blue spiky x white spiky): Offspring show both blue and white, no red. Smooth shell appears! This suggests shell shape inheritance: spiky x spiky can produce smooth. Need to analyze shell shape patterns.
Cross 107x109 (both blue smooth): Offspring mostly blue smooth, but white appears (ID120, 123). This confirms blue is not homozygous. Smooth appears to breed true when both parents are smooth.
Cross 116x120 (blue smooth tiny x white smooth large): Offspring show both blue and white, all smooth. No red appears. This supports color inheritance pattern.
Cross 66x67 (both white spiky): All offspring white spiky. White spiky breeds true. Need to test more shell shape combinations.
Cross 39x107 (red smooth x blue smooth): Offspring show red and blue, all smooth. No white appears. Smooth appears to breed true. Need to analyze body size inheritance.
Cross 45x49 (white ridged tiny x red ridged tiny): Offspring show red and white, all ridged tiny. This suggests body size may be controlled by multiple genes or dosage effects.
Cross 50x51 (red ridged extra_large x red ridged large): Offspring show various sizes: extra_large, large, tiny. White appears. Ridged appears in all offspring. Need to analyze body size inheritance pattern.
Self-cross of ID3 (white ridged tiny): All offspring white ridged tiny. White ridged tiny breeds true. This suggests homozygous recessive for all traits.
Self-cross of ID1 (red spiky extra_large): All offspring red spiky extra_large. This suggests ID1 is homozygous for red, spiky, and extra_large traits.
Self-cross of ID2 (blue smooth extra_large): Offspring blue smooth, but medium size appears. So ID2 is not homozygous for extra_large size. Blue and smooth appear to breed true.
Based on analysis: Color appears to have multiple alleles with complex interactions. Shell shape shows circular dominance or multiple alleles. Body size appears polygenic or with dosage effects. Need to formulate final report.
