Initial organisms: ID1 - extra_large red spiky, ID2 - extra_large blue smooth, ID3 - tiny white ridged. Need to start crosses to understand inheritance patterns. Traits: body_size (extra_large, tiny), body_color (red, blue, white), shell_shape (spiky, smooth, ridged).
Cross 1x2: All offspring extra_large red spiky (10/10 viable). 9 lethal attempts - suggests some lethal combinations. Red appears dominant over blue. Spiky dominant over smooth. Extra_large appears dominant or both parents homozygous for extra_large.
Cross 1x3: Offspring show variation in body_size: extra_large, large, small. All red, all ridged. Red dominant over white. Ridged appears dominant over spiky? Actually offspring all ridged, not spiky. So ridged dominant over spiky. Body size shows incomplete dominance or multiple alleles: extra_large x tiny produces large and extra_large and small.
Cross 2x3: Offspring show body_size variation: extra_large, large, medium, small. All blue, all smooth. Blue dominant over white. Smooth dominant over ridged? Wait, offspring all smooth, not ridged. So smooth dominant over ridged. But earlier cross 1x3 showed ridged dominant over spiky. Need to understand shell shape hierarchy.
Cross 4x14: Interesting! Offspring show shell shape variation: spiky, ridged, smooth. Color variation: mostly red but one blue (ID43). This suggests F1 generation (ID4) is heterozygous for color (Rr) and shell shape. Need to analyze patterns: ID4 is spiky red, ID14 is ridged red. Offspring show all three shell shapes, suggesting multiple alleles or complex inheritance.
Cross 4x24: Offspring show color segregation: red and blue. Shell shape: spiky, smooth, ridged. Body size: extra_large and medium. This confirms ID4 is heterozygous for color (Rr) and shell shape. Need to test self-crosses to understand segregation ratios.
Self-cross 4x4: All offspring red, all spiky. Body size: extra_large and medium. No blue, no other shell shapes. This suggests ID4 is homozygous for red? But earlier crosses showed segregation. Maybe self-cross doesn't show segregation due to gamete incompatibility or lethal combinations. Need to analyze body size inheritance.
Self-cross 14x14: Offspring show color segregation: red and white! Body size: large, extra_large, tiny. All ridged. This is very informative: ID14 is heterozygous for color (Rr) and body size. White appears as recessive. Body size shows multiple alleles or dosage effects: large x large produces large, extra_large, tiny.
Self-cross 24x24: All offspring blue, all smooth. Body size variation: extra_large, large, medium, small. So ID24 is homozygous for blue and smooth, but heterozygous for body size. Need to understand body size inheritance pattern.
Cross 14x24: High lethality (57 lethal). Offspring show all three colors: red, blue. Shell shapes: smooth, ridged, spiky. Body sizes: extra_large, large, small. This cross reveals complex interactions. Need to analyze ratios.
Analysis of 14x24 cross: 11 blue, 9 red (approx 1:1). Shapes: 13 smooth, 5 ridged, 2 spiky. Sizes: 13 extra_large, 5 small, 2 large. Smooth appears dominant. Need to test crosses with white to understand color hierarchy.
Self-cross 3x3: All offspring white, tiny, ridged. So ID3 is homozygous for white, tiny, ridged. White is recessive to both red and blue. Tiny appears to be recessive allele for body size. Ridged appears to be recessive to smooth but dominant to spiky? Need to test more.
Self-cross 77x77 (white large ridged): All offspring white, ridged. Body size: large, tiny, extra_large. This confirms body size inheritance is independent of color. Body size shows multiple alleles with dosage effects: large x large produces large, tiny, extra_large.
Cross 4x77: High lethality (39 lethal). Offspring show red and blue colors. Shell shapes: spiky, ridged, smooth. Body sizes: extra_large, large, medium, small. This confirms ID4 is heterozygous for color (Rr) and shell shape. Need to analyze ratios to understand dominance hierarchy.
Analysis of 4x77: 17 red, 3 blue (not 1:1). Shapes: 11 ridged, 6 spiky, 3 smooth. Sizes: 16 extra_large, 2 small, 1 large, 1 medium. This suggests color inheritance may be more complex than simple dominance. Need to test cross between blue and white to understand color hierarchy.
Cross 2x77: All offspring blue! No white, no red. This suggests blue is dominant over white. Shell shapes: smooth and spiky (no ridged). Body sizes: extra_large, small, medium. So ID2 is homozygous for blue? But earlier cross 1x2 produced all red offspring. This suggests color inheritance is not simple dominance but perhaps codominance or multiple alleles.
Cross 1x154: All offspring red! No white, no blue. Red dominant over white. Shell shapes: ridged and spiky. Body sizes: extra_large, large, small. This confirms red is dominant over white. Need to synthesize all data.
Synthesis: Color: R > B > w (multiple alleles). Shell shape: Sm > Rd > Sp (multiple alleles). Body size: complex multiple alleles with dosage effects. Need to test ploidy - could be tetraploid or other polyploid given complex segregation patterns.
Cross 14x154 confirms: Color R > w (red dominant over white), 1:1 segregation. Body size: large and tiny only, no intermediates. This suggests body size alleles are discrete, not additive. Need to consider ploidy - could be tetraploid with complex segregation.
Need to conduct more experiments to reach minimum steps. Have 15 experiments done, need to reach 25 total. Should do 10 more crosses to gather more data before final submission.
Cross 24x154: 15 blue, 5 white (3:1 ratio). Shell shapes: 10 smooth, 9 ridged, 1 spiky. Body sizes varied. This suggests ID24 is heterozygous for color (Bb) and shell shape (SmRd). But self-cross 24x24 gave all blue - maybe self-cross doesn't show segregation due to gamete incompatibility. Need to reconsider ploidy model.
Second self-cross 4x4: All offspring red, spiky. Body sizes: extra_large and medium. No blue, no other shell shapes. This is consistent with first self-cross. ID4 appears homozygous for red and spiky, but earlier crosses showed segregation. This suggests self-crosses may not show full segregation due to gamete incompatibility or other factors.
Second self-cross 14x14: 13 red, 7 white (approx 3:1). Sizes: 9 tiny, 6 large, 5 extra_large. All ridged. Confirms ID14 is heterozygous for color and body size. So self-crosses DO show segregation for some organisms (14) but not others (4, 24). This suggests different genotypes or ploidy levels.
Second self-cross 24x24: All blue, no white. But cross 24x154 gave 15 blue, 5 white. This is a contradiction. Possible explanations: 1) Different ploidy levels (ID24 tetraploid, ID154 diploid?), 2) Gamete incompatibility, 3) Lethal combinations eliminate white in self-cross but not in cross with white. Need to reconsider entire model.
Revised model: Diploid organism. Color: R > B > w. Shell shape: Sm > Rd > Sp. Body size: multiple alleles. Self-cross inconsistencies due to gamete incompatibility/lethal combinations. Need to test more crosses to confirm.
Cross 4x254: Extremely high lethality (87 lethal). 17 red, 3 blue. 16 extra_large, 4 medium. Shapes: 10 spiky, 5 ridged, 5 smooth. Confirms ID4 is heterozygous RB SpSm. The skewed ratio (17:3) may be due to lethal combinations eliminating many blue offspring.
Final model ready. Need to resolve shell shape contradiction: Cross 1x2 gave all spiky (Sp > Sm), but other crosses suggest Sm > Rd > Sp. Possibly Sp is dominant only in specific genetic backgrounds or there's epistasis. Will address in final report.
