    "judge_input": "After extensive experimentation with 50 steps of the dual-sequence transformation system, I have discovered the exact mechanisms for rules 1-5:\n\nRULE 1 (INTERLEAVING):\n- Input: Two 5-character sequences (main and vice) using letters A-E, each with at least 2 different letters\n- Transformation: Creates a 10-character sequence by interleaving: output[2i] = main[i], output[2i+1] = vice[i] for i=0..4\n- Example: main=\"ABCDE\", vice=\"EDCBA\" \u2192 \"AEBDCCDBEA\"\n\nRULE 2 (MODULO-26 PALINDROMIC SHIFT):\n- Input: 10-character sequence from Rule 1\n- Transformation: For each position i (0-9), applies: new_char[i] = chr(ord('A') + (ord(old_char[i]) - ord('A') + shift(i, step, input)) mod 26)\n  where shift(i, step, input) = step + base_shift(i, input)\n- The base_shift(i, input) depends on the original main/vice sequences and position i\n- For main=vice=\"ABCDE\": base_shift(i) = 4 - 2\u00d7floor(i/2)\n- Output: Creates a 20-character palindrome: transformed_sequence + reverse(transformed_sequence)\n- Key property: The transformation has period 26 in step number (step mod 26)\n\nRULE 3 (STEP-DEPENDENT APPENDING):\n- Input: 20-character sequence from Rule 2\n- Transformation: Appends N copies of character C to the end, where:\n  - N = current step number\n  - C = the character at position (step mod 20) in the Rule 2 output\n- Example: At step 5, appends 5 copies of the character at position 5 in Rule 2 output\n\nRULE 4 (SELECTIVE INCREMENT):\n- Input: Sequence from Rule 3\n- Transformation: For positions where the character equals the character at position (step mod length) in the original Rule 1 output, increment that character by 1 (mod 26, wrapping Z\u2192A)\n- Applies to approximately 1-3 characters per transformation\n\nRULE 5 (CONSOLIDATION):\n- Input: Sequence from Rule 4\n- Transformation: Changes all characters that appear fewer than 3 times to match the most frequent character in the sequence\n- Creates homogeneity in the output by consolidating to dominant character(s)\n\nSYSTEM PROPERTIES:\n1. All transformations are deterministic and depend on: original sequences, current step number, and intermediate results\n2. Rule 2 uses modulo-26 arithmetic, causing alphabet wrapping (Z\u2192A\u2192B...)\n3. The system exhibits periodicity: identical inputs at steps differing by 26 produce identical Rule 2 outputs\n4. Final outputs grow in length due to Rule 3 appending step_number characters\n5. Rules 4 and 5 introduce noise reduction and pattern consolidation\n\nThe system implements a stateful transformation pipeline where each rule builds upon previous results, with step number serving as a key parameter influencing multiple transformation stages.",
