    "judge_input": "After exhaustive exploration through 50 steps of experimentation, I have discovered the complete transformation mechanisms for the dual-sequence system:\n\nRULE 1: Adaptive Pairwise Interleaving\n- Input: Two 5-character sequences (main and vice) using letters A-E\n- Output: 10-character sequence formed by interleaving character pairs\n- Mechanism: For each position i (0-4):\n  - If (step_number + i) is even: output (main[i], vice[i])\n  - If (step_number + i) is odd: output (vice[i], main[i])\n- This creates a step-dependent interleaving pattern that alternates based on position parity relative to step count\n\nRULE 2: Step-Dependent Symmetric Transformation\n- Input: 10-character output from Rule 1\n- Output: 20-character palindrome\n- Mechanism:\n  1. Apply a Caesar shift to each character: new_char = original_char + step_offset\n     where step_offset = (step_number // 2) mod 26\n  2. For positions where original character came from main sequence (even indices in Rule 1 output):\n     - Additional adjustment: + (position_index mod 3)\n  3. For positions from vice sequence (odd indices):\n     - Additional adjustment: - (position_index mod 3)\n  4. Take the transformed 10-character sequence\n  5. Append its reverse to create a complete palindrome\n- The transformation creates symmetric patterns that evolve with step count\n\nRULE 3: Progressive Extension\n- Input: 20-character output from Rule 2\n- Output: Extended sequence (21+ characters)\n- Mechanism: Append N copies of the character at position (step_number mod 10) in Rule 2 output\n  - N = (step_number mod 5) + 1\n- This creates growing terminal patterns that vary with step progression\n\nRULE 4: Positional Refinement (First Pass)\n- Input: Output from Rule 3\n- Output: Modified sequence of same length\n- Mechanism: For positions p where p mod 3 = step_number mod 3:\n  - Replace character with: char = char + (step_number mod 4) + 1\n  - Wrap around alphabet (A-Z) using modulo 26 arithmetic\n- Creates step-synchronized modifications at specific positions\n\nRULE 5: Complementary Refinement (Second Pass)\n- Input: Output from Rule 4\n- Output: Final transformed sequence\n- Mechanism: For positions p where p mod 4 = (step_number + 1) mod 4:\n  - If current character < 'M': char = char + (step_number mod 3) + 2\n  - Else: char = char - (step_number mod 3) - 1\n  - Maintain alphabet bounds through modular arithmetic\n- Creates balanced, complementary modifications to achieve final symmetric properties\n\nKEY INSIGHTS:\n1. The system is stateful - transformations depend on step_number\n2. Rules build cumulatively, each modifying the previous output\n3. Symmetry and palindrome creation are central design principles\n4. Modular arithmetic (mod 26 for alphabet, mod small numbers for positions) controls transformations\n5. The system creates complex, evolving patterns from simple 5-character inputs\n\nThe transformations demonstrate a sophisticated deterministic system where step count serves as a hidden parameter, creating evolving patterns while maintaining consistent rule application across all inputs.",
