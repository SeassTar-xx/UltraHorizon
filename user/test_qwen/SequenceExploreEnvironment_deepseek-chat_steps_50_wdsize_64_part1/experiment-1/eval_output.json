    "judge_input": "Based on extensive testing and analysis, I have discovered the following transformation rules for the dual-sequence system:\n\nRULE 1: Pair Formation with Palindrome Optimization\n- Input: Two 5-character sequences (main and vice)\n- Output: 10-character string formed from 5 pairs\n- For each position i (0-4), create a pair from (main[i], vice[i])\n- The order within each pair is determined to optimize palindrome structure:\n  1. If main[i] == vice[i], output is main[i]+vice[i] (e.g., \"AA\", \"BB\")\n  2. For symmetric positions i and (4-i):\n     - If the unordered pairs are identical (e.g., (A,B) and (A,B)), output same ordered pair at both positions\n     - If the unordered pairs are reverses (e.g., (A,B) and (B,A)), output reverse ordered pairs\n     - This creates palindrome structure when possible\n  3. Default ordering (when no palindrome constraint) appears to be alphabetical order\n\nRULE 2: Symmetric Transformation with Position-Dependent Mapping\n- Input: 10-character output from Rule 1\n- Output: 20-character symmetric string\n- Transformation: Applies a position-dependent substitution cipher to each character\n- The cipher mapping depends on both the character value and its position\n- After transforming all 10 characters, appends the reverse of the transformed string\n- Result: First 10 chars = transformed string, Last 10 chars = reverse of transformed string\n- Creates perfect symmetry: output[10:20] = output[9::-1]\n\nRULE 3: Character Appending\n- Input: 20-character output from Rule 2\n- Output: Longer string (typically 22-30 characters)\n- Appends 2-10 additional characters to the end\n- The appended characters often repeat the last character or follow a pattern based on the input\n- In many cases, appends repeated copies of the last character of Rule 2 output\n\nRULE 4: Selective Character Modification\n- Input: Output from Rule 3\n- Output: Modified version with some characters changed\n- Modifies characters at specific positions (often early positions)\n- The modification appears to follow a pattern based on neighboring characters or original sequence values\n- Changes are not random but follow deterministic rules\n\nRULE 5: Final Transformation (Conditional)\n- Input: Output from Rule 4\n- Output: May or may not modify the string\n- In some cases, Rule 5 applies additional transformations\n- In other cases, leaves the string unchanged\n- Appears to apply only under specific conditions related to sequence content\n\nKey Observations:\n1. The system is deterministic - same inputs always produce same outputs\n2. Rules build upon previous outputs in a chain\n3. Rule 1 focuses on creating structured pairs, Rule 2 creates symmetry, Rules 3-5 add complexity\n4. The transformations use extended alphabet beyond A-E (including F-Z)\n5. The system appears designed to create complex, structured outputs from simple inputs",
