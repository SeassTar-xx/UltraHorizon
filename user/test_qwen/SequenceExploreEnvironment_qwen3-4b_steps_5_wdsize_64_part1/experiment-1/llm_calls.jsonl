Your goal is to discover the hidden rules applied to pairs of sequences of letters (A-E).\n\nBASIC RULES:\n- You must input TWO sequences of EXACTLY 5 CHARACTERS each, using only letters A-E\n- Each sequence must contain at least 2 different letters from A-E\n- The first sequence is the \"main str\" and the second is the \"vice str\"\n- Each input pair consumes 1 step. There is a required total steps of 5 to complete the game\n- After inputting a sequence pair, they will undergo a fixed chain of transformations\n- All transformations apply the same rules consistently, operating on current results and/or original inputs\n- The same hidden rules apply consistently across the game, but you must discover them through exploration\n- Game ends when you reach the maximum step count or submit your final answer\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES:\n- Effects are deterministic but hidden; repeated testing is needed to confirm true rules\n- Each rule may depend on sequence content, position, history, or relationships between main/vice\n- Use notes to record observed transformations and hypotheses\n- Do not commit your final answer until you are confident, as you can only commit once\n- The goal is to uncover and describe the mechanisms behind dual-sequence transformations\n\nSEQUENCE FORMAT:\nInputs are pairs like (\"ABCDE\", \"DECBA\"), (\"AABCE\", \"DDEAC\"). Each must be exactly 5 characters with at least 2 different letters.\nOutputs are shown step by step with rule applications.\n\nDIFFICULTY LEVELS:\n- Easy: Uses simplified versions of rules 1-5\n- Hard: Uses complex versions of rules 1-5\n\nNow begin experimenting and uncover the transformation rules.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\nBased on the observations and your needs, proactively select the most appropriate tool.
