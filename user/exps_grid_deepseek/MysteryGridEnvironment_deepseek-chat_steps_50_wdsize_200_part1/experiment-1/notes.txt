Starting exploration. Initial position: (7,5,D). Energy: 20, Score: 0, Steps: 0. Nearby tiles show various letters. Need to systematically explore effects of A, B, C, D, E. First, let's move to nearby tiles to observe initial effects.
Step 1: Moved up from (7,5,D) to (7,6,B). Energy: 19, Score: 0. No score change from B tile. Need to check if B has any effect.
Step 2: Moved up to (7,7,E). Energy: 18, Score: 0. No score change from E tile. Need to explore more tiles to see patterns.
Step 3: Moved left to (6,7,E). Energy: 17, Score: -1. Score decreased by 1! First observed effect: E tile at (6,7) gave -1 score. Need to check if this is consistent for E tiles or depends on something.
Step 4: Moved left to (5,7,C). Energy: 16, Score: 0. Score increased by 1 from -1 to 0. So C tile gave +1 score. Need to verify if this is consistent.
Step 5: Moved down to (5,6,D). Energy: 15, Score: 1. Score increased by 1 from 0 to 1. So D tile gave +1 score. Need to check if D always gives +1.
Step 6: Moved down to (5,5,A). Energy: 14, Score: 3. Score increased by 2 from 1 to 3. So A tile gave +2 score. Need to verify if A always gives +2.
Step 7: Moved right to (6,5,B). Energy: 13, Score: 3. No score change from B tile. So far B seems to have no effect on score. Need to check if B affects energy or something else.
Step 8: Moved right to (7,5,D). Energy: 12, Score: 4. Score increased by 1 from 3 to 4. D tile gave +1 again. This is now X (previously visited D). Wait, the tile shows D but should be X if previously visited. Let me check if tiles reset or something.
Current state shows (7,5,X) - so it is X now. The previous output showed D but that might have been a display issue. Score increased from 3 to 4 when stepping on X tile? That's strange - X should have no effect. Let me check if stepping on X tiles gives +1? Or maybe the effect is from something else.
Step 9: Moved up to (7,6,X). Energy: 11, Score: 4. No score change on X tile. So X tiles indeed have no effect. The previous score increase from 3 to 4 must have been from something else. Let me continue exploring new tiles.
Step 10: Moved up to (7,7,X). Energy: 10, Score: 4. No change. Need to find new tiles. Let me go to (7,3,A) which is nearby.
Step 13: Moved down to (7,4,D). Energy: 17 (increased from 8 to 17!), Score: 2 (decreased from 4 to 2). D tile gave +9 energy and -2 score? Wait, energy increased by 9, score decreased by 2. This is different from previous D tile which gave +1 score. So D effect is not consistent. Need to investigate further.
Step 14: Moved down to (7,3,A). Energy: 16 (decreased by 1 for move), Score: 1 (decreased by 1 from 2). A tile gave -1 score? Previous A gave +2. So A effect is also not consistent. Need to reset and test more systematically.
Reset #1. New initial position: (6,3,E). Need to systematically test each letter. Let me first check nearby tiles and plan exploration.
Nearby tiles: (4,3,A), (6,1,B), (8,3,B), (8,5,D), (4,5,A), (6,5,E), (8,1,D), (4,1,E). Starting on E tile at (6,3,E). Let me step on it to see effect.
Step 1: Moved right to (7,3,C). Energy: 19, Score: 1. C gave +1 score. Starting tile E at (6,3,E) gave no effect? Actually we started on it, maybe starting tile doesn't trigger effect. Need to test E tile by moving to another E.
Step 2: Moved right to (8,3,B). Energy: 18, Score: 4. Score increased by 3 from 1 to 4! B gave +3 score? Previous B gave no effect. So B effect varies. Need to track patterns.
Step 3: Moved down to (8,2,C). Energy: 17, Score: 4. No score change from C tile. Previous C gave +1. So C effect also varies.
Step 4: Moved down to (8,1,D). Energy: 16, Score: 5. Score increased by 1 from 4 to 5. D gave +1 score. Previous D gave +9 energy and -2 score. So D effect varies too.
Step 5: Moved left to (7,1,E). Energy: 15, Score: 11. Score increased by 6 from 5 to 11! E gave +6 score. Previous E gave -1 score. So E effect varies dramatically.
Step 6: Moved left to (6,1,B). Energy: 14, Score: 14. Score increased by 3 from 11 to 14. B gave +3 score again. So B seems to consistently give +3 in this game.
Step 7: Moved up to (6,2,A). Energy: 13, Score: 13. Score decreased by 1 from 14 to 13. A gave -1 score. Previous A gave +2 and -1. So A effect varies.
Step 8: Moved up to (6,3,E) - starting position, now X? Actually shows E but should be X. Energy: 12, Score: 16. Score increased by 3 from 13 to 16. E gave +3 score. Previous E gave +6 and -1. So effects vary by position or some other factor.
Current state shows X at (6,3). So it is X now. The score increase from 13 to 16 happened on X tile? That's 3 points. Or maybe the effect is triggered when leaving a tile? Need to think about patterns. Let me check if effects depend on step count, energy, position, or visit count.
Step 9: Moved right to (7,3,X). Energy: 11, Score: 16. No change on X tile. So X tiles have no effect. The previous score increase must have been from something else. Let me continue exploring new tiles to gather more data.
Steps 10-15: Moving through X tiles, no score changes. Need to find new tiles. Let me go to (4,3,A) or (4,5,A) or (6,5,E) or (8,5,D).
Step 17: Moved left to (5,3,D). Energy: 13 (increased from 4 to 13, +9), Score: 14 (decreased from 16 to 14, -2). D gave +9 energy and -2 score. Same pattern as previous D at (7,4,D). So D sometimes gives +9 energy and -2 score, sometimes +1 score. Need to find pattern.
Step 18: Moved left to (4,3,A). Energy: 12, Score: 16. Score increased by 2 from 14 to 16. A gave +2 score. Previous A gave -1 and +2. So A effect varies.
Step 19: Moved down to (4,2,C). Energy: 11, Score: 17. Score increased by 1 from 16 to 17. C gave +1 score. Previous C gave +1 and 0. So C sometimes gives +1, sometimes 0.
Step 20: Moved down to (4,1,E). Energy: 10, Score: 20. Score increased by 3 from 17 to 20. E gave +3 score. Previous E gave +6, -1, +3. So E effect varies.
Step 21: Moved right to (5,1,D). Energy: 19 (increased from 10 to 19, +9), Score: 18 (decreased from 20 to 18, -2). D gave +9 energy and -2 score again. Pattern: D gives +9 energy and -2 score when energy is low? Let me check: Previous D at (5,3,D): energy was 4 -> 13 (+9), score 16 -> 14 (-2). D at (7,4,D): energy was 8 -> 17 (+9), score 4 -> 2 (-2). D at (8,1,D): energy was 16 -> 16 (no change), score 4 -> 5 (+1). So when energy is below some threshold, D gives +9 energy and -2 score. When energy is higher, D gives +1 score.
Game over at step 30. Score: 18, Energy: 10. Observations so far: Effects vary. Need to reset and test more systematically. Let me analyze patterns: 1) D: When energy < 10? Actually D gave +9 energy and -2 score at energies 4, 8, 10. At energy 16, gave +1 score. 2) B: Gave +3 score twice in this game, 0 in first game. 3) A: Gave +2, -1, +2. 4) C: Gave +1, 0, +1. 5) E: Gave -1, +6, +3, +3. Need more data.
Reset #2. New initial position: (5,0,D). Need to test systematically. Let me first check nearby tiles and plan to test each letter under different conditions.
Nearby tiles: (3,0,B), (3,2,D), (5,2,A), (7,0,B), (7,2,B). Starting on D tile at (5,0,D). Let me move to test D effect with high energy (20).
Step 1: Moved right to (6,0,B). Energy: 19, Score: 3. B gave +3 score. Starting D tile gave no effect (starting tile). B consistently gives +3 in this game too.
Step 2: Moved right to (7,0,B). Energy: 18, Score: 6. B gave +3 score again. So B consistently gives +3 in this game.
Step 3: Moved up to (7,1,B). Energy: 17, Score: 9. B gave +3 score again. B seems to always give +3. But in first game, B gave 0. Maybe B effect depends on something else.
Step 4: Moved left to (6,1,E). Energy: 16, Score: 14. E gave +5 score. Previous E gave various values. Need to track pattern.
Step 5: Moved left to (5,1,B). Energy: 15, Score: 17. B gave +3 score. B consistently +3.
Step 6: Moved down to (5,0,D) - starting position, now X. Energy: 14, Score: 18. Score increased by 1 from 17 to 18. X tile gave +1? Or maybe D effect triggered? Actually this is X tile now. Score increased by 1. Hmm.
Current observations from previous games:
1. B: Sometimes gives +3 score, sometimes 0. Need to find pattern.
2. D: Sometimes gives +9 energy and -2 score (when energy low?), sometimes +1 score (when energy high?).
3. A: Gave +2, -1, +2. Inconsistent.
4. C: Gave +1, 0, +1. Sometimes gives +1, sometimes 0.
5. E: Gave -1, +6, +3, +3, +5. Highly variable.

Need to systematically test each letter under different conditions: different energy levels, step counts, positions, etc. Let me continue current game to gather more data.
Need to analyze patterns more systematically. Let me reconstruct sequences:

Game 1 sequence:
Step 1: (7,6,B) - score 0 (no change)
Step 2: (7,7,E) - score 0 (no change) 
Step 3: (6,7,E) - score -1
Step 4: (5,7,C) - score +1 (0 to 1)
Step 5: (5,6,D) - score +1 (1 to 2)
Step 6: (5,5,A) - score +2 (2 to 4)
Step 7: (6,5,B) - score 0 (4 to 4)
Step 8: (7,5,D) - score +1 (4 to 5) - but this was X tile?
... later
Step 13: (7,4,D) - energy +9, score -2 (4 to 2)
Step 14: (7,3,A) - score -1 (2 to 1)

Game 2 sequence:
Step 1: (7,3,C) - score +1 (0 to 1)
Step 2: (8,3,B) - score +3 (1 to 4)
Step 3: (8,2,C) - score 0 (4 to 4)
Step 4: (8,1,D) - score +1 (4 to 5)
Step 5: (7,1,E) - score +6 (5 to 11)
Step 6: (6,1,B) - score +3 (11 to 14)
Step 7: (6,2,A) - score -1 (14 to 13)
Step 8: (6,3,E) - score +3 (13 to 16) - X tile?
... later
Step 17: (5,3,D) - energy +9, score -2 (16 to 14)
Step 18: (4,3,A) - score +2 (14 to 16)
Step 19: (4,2,C) - score +1 (16 to 17)
Step 20: (4,1,E) - score +3 (17 to 20)
Step 21: (5,1,D) - energy +9, score -2 (20 to 18)

Game 3 sequence:
Step 1: (6,0,B) - score +3 (0 to 3)
Step 2: (7,0,B) - score +3 (3 to 6)
Step 3: (7,1,B) - score +3 (6 to 9)
Step 4: (6,1,E) - score +5 (9 to 14)
Step 5: (5,1,B) - score +3 (14 to 17)
Step 6: (5,0,D) - score +1 (17 to 18) - X tile?

Observations:
1. D clearly has energy threshold: ≤10 energy gives +9 energy and -2 score, >10 energy gives +1 score.
2. B: 0 in Game 1, +3 in Games 2 and 3. Maybe B gives 0 on first game only?
3. A: +2, -1, -1, +2. No clear pattern.
4. C: +1, +1, 0, +1. Mostly +1, sometimes 0.
5. E: -1, +6, +3, +3, +5. Highly variable.

Need to find underlying rules. Could be:
- Step count parity
- Energy parity  
- Position-based (x+y parity)
- Visit count to letter type
- Some combination
