Game started at (3,3,D). Energy: 20, Score: 0, Steps: 0. Nearby tiles show letters A-E. Need to explore systematically to discover effects of each letter. First, let's explore nearby tiles and record effects.
Step 1: Moved up to (3,4,B). Energy: 19, Score: 0. No score change from B tile. Need to test more B tiles.
Step 2: Moved right to (4,4,C). Energy: 18, Score: +1 (now 1). C tile gave +1 score. Need to test more C tiles.
Step 3: Moved right to (5,4,D). Energy: 17, Score: +1 (now 2). D tile gave +1 score. Need to test more D tiles.
Step 4: Moved down to (5,3,E). Energy: 16, Score: +2 (now 4). E tile gave +2 score. Need to test more E tiles.
Step 5: Moved down to (5,2,D). Energy: 15, Score: +1 (now 5). D tile gave +1 score again. So far: C=+1, D=+1, E=+2, B=0. Need to test A tile.
Step 6: Moved left to (4,2,D). Energy: 14, Score: +1 (now 6). D tile gave +1 again. Need to find A tile. Let's check full map.
Full map obtained. Current position (4,2) is X (visited D). Need to find nearest A tile. Looking at map: (4,1) is A, (7,2) is A, (7,5) is A, etc. Let's go to (4,1) A tile.
Step 7: Moved down to (4,1,A). Energy: 13, Score: -1 (now 5). A tile gave -1 score! Interesting. So A = -1 score. Need to verify with another A tile.
Step 8: Moved right to (5,1,E). Energy: 12, Score: +4 (now 9). E tile gave +4 score! Wait, earlier E gave +2. So E effect might depend on something. Need to investigate.
Step 9: Moved right to (6,1,A). Energy: 11, Score: +2 (now 11). A tile gave +2 score! Earlier A gave -1. So A effect is not consistent. Need to analyze patterns. Could depend on position, step count, energy, or visit count.
Step 10: Moved right to (7,1,B). Energy: 10, Score: +3 (now 14). B tile gave +3 score! Earlier B gave 0. So B also varies. Need systematic testing.
Observations so far: Effects vary. Need to record all data: Step, Position, Letter, Score change, Energy, Total score. Let's continue exploring to gather more data.
Step 11: Moved up to (7,2,A). Energy: 9, Score: -1 (now 13). A gave -1 again. So A gave -1 at (4,1) and (7,2), but +2 at (6,1). Need to check coordinates pattern.
Step 12: Moved up to (7,3,D). Energy: +9 (now 18), Score: -2 (now 11). D gave +9 energy and -2 score! Earlier D gave +1 score. So D effect varies too. Energy gain observed.
Step 13: Moved up to (7,4,A). Energy: 17, Score: -1 (now 10). A gave -1 again. So A seems to give -1 except at (6,1) which gave +2. Check if (6,1) is special.
Step 14: Moved up to (7,5,A). Energy: 16, Score: -1 (now 9). A gave -1 again. So (6,1) A is anomaly. Maybe effect depends on step count? Let's test more letters.
Step 15: Moved left to (6,5,B). Energy: 15, Score: 0 (no change). B gave 0. Earlier B gave +3 at (7,1). So B varies.
Step 16: Moved left to (5,5,C). Energy: 14, Score: 0 (no change). C gave 0. Earlier C gave +1 at (4,4). So C varies too.
Step 17: Moved left to (4,5,C). Energy: 13, Score: +1 (now 10). C gave +1 again. So C sometimes +1, sometimes 0.
Step 18: Moved left to (3,5,D). Energy: 12, Score: +1 (now 11). D gave +1 score. Earlier D gave +9 energy and -2 score at (7,3). So D varies greatly.
Step 19: Moved down to (3,4,X) (visited B earlier). No effect as expected. Energy 11, steps 19. Need to analyze patterns. Let's check notes and think.
Analysis: Effects seem to depend on something. Let's check if effects correlate with step count parity (odd/even), energy level, or coordinates. Need more systematic testing. Let's continue exploring to gather more data.
Step 20: Moved down to (3,3,D). Energy: 10, Score: +1 (now 12). D gave +1 again. So D mostly +1 except (7,3) which gave +9 energy and -2 score.
Step 21: Moved right to (4,3,E). Energy: 9, Score: +1 (now 13). E gave +1. Earlier E gave +2 and +4. So E varies: +4, +2, +1.
Step 22: Moved right to (5,3,X) (visited E earlier). No effect. Energy 8, steps 22. Need to test more letters. Let's go find B and C tiles.
Step 23: Moved right to (6,3,C). Energy: 7, Score: 0 (no change). C gave 0. Earlier C gave +1 at steps 2 and 17, 0 at steps 16 and 23.
Step 24: Moved up to (6,4,D). Energy: +9 (now 16), Score: -2 (now 11). D gave +9 energy and -2 score again! Similar to (7,3)D. So D at certain positions gives energy boost and score penalty.
Step 25: Moved up to (6,5,X) (visited B earlier). No effect. Energy 15, steps 25. Need to analyze patterns. Let's check coordinates of special D tiles: (7,3) and (6,4) both gave +9 energy, -2 score. Other D tiles gave +1 score.
Hypothesis: Effects might depend on energy level modulo something. Need more testing. Let's continue exploring to gather more data points.
Step 26: Moved left to (5,5,X) (visited C earlier). No effect. Energy 14, steps 26. Need to find new letters. Let's go to (4,6) which is A according to map.
Step 27: Moved down to (5,4,X) (visited D earlier). No effect. Energy 13, steps 27. Need to go to (4,6)A. Let's go left then down.
Step 28: Moved left to (4,4,X) (visited C earlier). No effect. Energy 12, steps 28. Need to go down to (4,6)A.
Step 29: Moved down to (4,3,X) (visited E earlier). No effect. Energy 11, steps 29. One step left. Need to go down to (4,6)A but need 2 steps. Let's go down anyway to see what happens.
Step 30: Moved down to (4,2,X) (visited D earlier). Game over due to max steps (30). Energy 10, score 11. Need to reset and conduct more systematic tests.
Reset #1. New start position: (4,0,C). Energy: 20. Need to test letters systematically. Let's first explore nearby tiles and record effects carefully.
Current at (4,0,C). Nearby: (2,0)B, (2,2)A, (4,2)A, (6,0)C, (6,2)D. Let's move to (4,2)A to test A with energy 19.
Step 1: Moved up to (4,1,B). Energy: 19, Score: +3 (now 3). B gave +3. Earlier B gave 0 or +3. Energy before move was 20.
Step 2: Moved up to (4,2,A). Energy: 18, Score: -1 (now 2). A gave -1. Energy before move was 19. So A gave -1 again.
Step 3: Moved right to (5,2,D). Energy: 17, Score: +1 (now 3). D gave +1. Energy before move was 18.
Step 4: Moved right to (6,2,D). Energy: 16, Score: +1 (now 4). D gave +1 again. Energy before move was 17.
Step 5: Moved down to (6,1,D). Energy: 15, Score: +1 (now 5). D gave +1 again. Energy before move was 16.
Step 6: Moved down to (6,0,C). Energy: 14, Score: +1 (now 6). C gave +1. Energy before move was 15.
Step 7: Moved left to (5,0,C). Energy: 13, Score: 0 (no change). C gave 0. Energy before move was 14. So C sometimes +1, sometimes 0.
Step 8: Moved left to (4,0,C). Energy: 12, Score: +1 (now 7). C gave +1. Energy before move was 13. Starting tile C gave +1.
Analysis: Not clear pattern with mod4. Let's check mod5. Also note special D tiles at (7,3) and (6,4) gave +9 energy, -2 score. Those positions might be special. Need to test more systematically. Let's continue exploring.
Mod5 also not clear. Maybe effect depends on position coordinates? Or visit count? Need more systematic testing. Let's continue exploring to find E and test more letters.
Step 9: Moved left to (3,0,C). Energy: 11, Score: 0 (no change). C gave 0. Energy before move was 12.
Current understanding from previous notes:
1. A: Mostly gives -1 score, but gave +2 at (6,1) once. Need to test more A tiles.
2. B: Sometimes gives 0, sometimes +3. Need pattern.
3. C: Sometimes gives +1, sometimes 0. Need pattern.
4. D: Mostly gives +1 score, but at positions (7,3) and (6,4) gave +9 energy and -2 score. These might be special positions.
5. E: Gave +4, +2, +1 at different times.

Hypotheses:
- Effects might depend on energy level modulo something (mod4, mod5 tested, not clear)
- Might depend on step count parity
- Might depend on coordinates (special D positions suggest coordinate-based effects)
- Might depend on visit count of that letter type

Plan: Continue exploring systematically, recording step, position, letter, energy before move, score change, total score. Need to test each letter multiple times under different conditions.
Step 10: (3,1,D). Energy before: 11, after: 10. Score before: 7, after: 8. D gave +1 score. Normal D behavior.
Step 11: (2,1,A). Energy before: 10, after: 9. Score before: 8, after: 7. A gave -1 score. Consistent with most A tiles.
Step 12: (1,1,A). Energy before: 9, after: 8. Score before: 7, after: 9. A gave +2 score! Important observation: A gave +2 at (6,1) and (1,1) - both y-coordinate = 1. Other A tiles gave -1. Hypothesis: A effect depends on y-coordinate? Need to test more A tiles at different y positions.
Step 13: (1,0,B). Energy before: 8, after: 7. Score before: 9, after: 12. B gave +3 score. Earlier B gave +3 at (7,1) and (4,1), 0 at (3,4) and (6,5). Need to find pattern.
Step 14: (2,0,B). Energy before: 7, after: 6. Score before: 12, after: 15. B gave +3 score. B seems to give +3 at positions with y=0 or y=1? Need to check: (1,0)B gave +3, (2,0)B gave +3, (4,1)B gave +3, (7,1)B gave +3. B gave 0 at (3,4) and (6,5) which have y=4 and y=5. Hypothesis: B gives +3 when y-coordinate is 0 or 1, 0 otherwise.
Step 17: (1,2,E). Energy before: 4, after: 3. Score before: 15, after: 14. E gave -1 score! New observation. Earlier E gave +4 at (5,1), +2 at (3,4), +1 at (4,3). Now -1 at (1,2). Need to find pattern. Check coordinates: (5,1) gave +4 (y=1), (3,4) gave +2 (y=4), (4,3) gave +1 (y=3), (1,2) gave -1 (y=2). Not obvious pattern.
Step 18: (2,2,A). Energy before: 3, after: 2. Score before: 14, after: 16. A gave +2 score at y=2. Earlier: (6,1)A gave +2, (1,1)A gave +2, but (4,1)A gave -1. So not simply y-coordinate. Need more data. Also (7,2)A gave -1, (7,4)A gave -1, (7,5)A gave -1. Maybe depends on both x and y coordinates or some other factor.
Step 19: (3,2,C). Energy before: 2, after: 1. Score before: 16, after: 17. C gave +1 score. C pattern: sometimes +1, sometimes 0. Need to find pattern.
COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS OF ALL OBSERVATIONS:

A TILES:
- (4,1)A: -1 score (step 7, game 1)
- (6,1)A: +2 score (step 9, game 1) 
- (7,2)A: -1 score (step 11, game 1)
- (7,4)A: -1 score (step 13, game 1)
- (7,5)A: -1 score (step 14, game 1)
- (4,2)A: -1 score (step 2, game 2)
- (6,1)A: +2 score (step 9, game 1) - duplicate?
- (2,1)A: -1 score (step 11, game 2)
- (1,1)A: +2 score (step 12, game 2)
- (2,2)A: +2 score (step 18, game 2)

Pattern: A seems to give +2 at some positions, -1 at others. Not simply y-coordinate. Check if depends on parity of coordinates: 
(6,1): x even, y odd -> +2
(1,1): x odd, y odd -> +2  
(2,2): x even, y even -> +2
(4,1): x even, y odd -> -1 (contradicts (6,1))
(7,2): x odd, y even -> -1
(7,4): x odd, y even -> -1
(7,5): x odd, y odd -> -1
(4,2): x even, y even -> -1 (contradicts (2,2))
(2,1): x even, y odd -> -1 (contradicts (6,1))

So not simple parity. Maybe depends on sum of coordinates mod something?

B TILES:
- (3,4)B: 0 score (step 1, game 1)
- (7,1)B: +3 score (step 10, game 1)
- (6,5)B: 0 score (step 15, game 1)
- (4,1)B: +3 score (step 1, game 2)
- (1,0)B: +3 score (step 13, game 2)
- (2,0)B: +3 score (step 14, game 2)

Pattern: B gives +3 at y=0 or y=1 positions, 0 at y>=4 positions. Need to test y=2,3.

C TILES:
- (4,4)C: +1 score (step 2, game 1)
- (5,5)C: 0 score (step 16, game 1)
- (4,5)C: +1 score (step 17, game 1)
- (6,0)C: +1 score (step 6, game 2)
- (5,0)C: 0 score (step 7, game 2)
- (4,0)C: +1 score (step 8, game 2)
- (3,0)C: 0 score (step 9, game 2)
- (6,3)C: 0 score (step 23, game 1)
- (3,2)C: +1 score (step 19, game 2)

Pattern: C sometimes +1, sometimes 0. Need pattern.

D TILES:
- (5,4)D: +1 score (step 3, game 1)
- (5,2)D: +1 score (step 5, game 1)
- (4,2)D: +1 score (step 6, game 1)
- (7,3)D: +9 energy, -2 score (step 12, game 1)
- (3,3)D: +1 score (step 20, game 1)
- (6,4)D: +9 energy, -2 score (step 24, game 1)
- (5,2)D: +1 score (step 3, game 2)
- (6,2)D: +1 score (step 4, game 2)
- (6,1)D: +1 score (step 5, game 2)
- (3,1)D: +1 score (step 10, game 2)

Pattern: D mostly gives +1 score, but at positions (7,3) and (6,4) gives +9 energy and -2 score. These might be special positions.

E TILES:
- (5,2)E: +2 score (step 4, game 1)
- (5,1)E: +4 score (step 8, game 1)
- (4,3)E: +1 score (step 21, game 1)
- (1,2)E: -1 score (step 17, game 2)

Pattern: E varies: +4, +2, +1, -1. Need pattern.

NEXT STEPS: Need systematic testing of each letter at different coordinates to find patterns. Test each letter at multiple positions, record coordinates and effects.
