    "judge_input": "Based on systematic exploration and analysis, here are the effects for each letter:\n\nA: The effect depends on step count modulo 3. When step count % 3 == 0, A gives +2 score. Otherwise, A gives -1 score.\n\nB: The effect depends on the y-coordinate. When y < 2 (i.e., y = 0 or 1), B gives +3 score. Otherwise, B gives 0 score change.\n\nC: The effect depends on the x-coordinate parity. When x is even, C gives +1 score. When x is odd, C gives 0 score change.\n\nD: The effect depends on the sum of coordinates (x+y). When x+y = 10, D gives +9 energy and -2 score. Otherwise, D gives +1 score.\n\nE: The effect depends on the difference between coordinates (x-y). E gives a score change equal to (x - y). For example, at position (5,1): 5-1=4 gives +4 score; at (1,2): 1-2=-1 gives -1 score.",
