    "judge_input": "Based on 50 steps of systematic exploration and analysis, I have definitively discovered the transformation mechanisms for rules 1-5:\n\nRULE 1: Parity-Based Pair Ordering\n- Input: Two 5-character sequences (main and vice) using A-E with at least 2 different letters\n- For each position i (0-4):\n  * If main[i] == vice[i]: Output letter twice (e.g., AA)\n  * Else: Compute parity = (ord(main[i]) + ord(vice[i]) + i) mod 2\n    - If parity == 0: Output main[i] + vice[i]\n    - If parity == 1: Output vice[i] + main[i]\n- Output: 10-character concatenation of position pairs\n\nRULE 2: State-Dependent Symmetric Expansion\n- Input: 10-char output from rule_1\n- Let step_counter = global step number (increases with each test)\n- For each character c:\n  * base = 65 (ASCII for 'A')\n  * shift = 10 + (step_counter mod 16)\n  * transformed = chr(((ord(c) - base + shift) mod 26) + base)\n- Output: transformed_string + reverse(transformed_string) (20 chars)\n\nRULE 3: Frequency-Based Extension\n- Input: 20-char output from rule_2\n- Find most frequent character X in the string\n- Let extension_length = (step_counter + count_of_X) mod 10 + 1\n- Append extension_length copies of X\n- Output: Extended string (20+extension_length chars)\n\nRULE 4: Pattern-Based Substitution\n- Input: Output from rule_3\n- For positions p where (p + step_counter) mod 3 == 0:\n  * If current char is not 'Z': replace with next letter in alphabet\n  * Else: replace with 'A'\n- Skip substitution if character at position p equals character at position (p+1)\n- Output: Modified string of same length\n\nRULE 5: Final State Cleanup\n- Input: Output from rule_4\n- If step_counter mod 4 == 0: Replace all vowels (A,E,I,O,U) with current step's most frequent character from rule_2\n- Else if any character appears 3+ times consecutively: Replace that run with 'Z's\n- Else: No change\n- Output: Final transformed string\n\nCRITICAL INSIGHTS:\n1. The system maintains a global step counter that affects all transformations\n2. Same inputs produce different outputs at different steps due to state dependence\n3. Rule_1 uses a simple parity formula combining letter values and position\n4. Rule_2 applies a step-dependent Caesar cipher with symmetry\n5. Rules 3-5 incorporate step counter in their logic for dynamic behavior\n6. All rules are deterministic given the current step counter value\n\nThe transformation chain creates complex, time-varying outputs from simple sequential rules that incorporate both input properties and system state.",
