    "judge_input": "After extensive exploration of the dual-sequence transformation system through 50 test steps, I have discovered the following transformation rules:\n\nRULE 1: Conditional Pairwise Concatenation\n- Input: Two 5-character sequences (main and vice) using letters A-E\n- Output: 10-character sequence formed by concatenating character pairs from each position\n- Mechanism depends on step number parity:\n  * EVEN steps: For position i (0-4):\n    - If main[i] < vice[i] (alphabetically): output vice[i] + main[i] (reverse alphabetical order)\n    - If main[i] > vice[i]: output main[i] + vice[i] (alphabetical order)\n    - If equal: output letter + same letter\n  * ODD steps: For position i (0-4):\n    - If main[i] < vice[i]: output main[i] + vice[i] (alphabetical order)\n    - If main[i] > vice[i]: output vice[i] + main[i] (reverse alphabetical order)\n    - If equal: output letter + same letter\n- This creates a symmetric pattern where even and odd steps use opposite comparison rules\n\nRULE 2: Symmetric Transformation with Mirroring\n- Input: 10-character output from Rule 1\n- Output: 20-character symmetric sequence\n- Core mechanism:\n  1. Apply a position-dependent transformation to each character of Rule 1 output\n  2. Append the reverse of this transformed sequence\n- Transformation characteristics:\n  * Uses modular arithmetic extending beyond Z (observed letters up to Z and beyond)\n  * Shift amount varies by both position and step number\n  * Same input letter can map to different output letters within same step\n  * Transformation appears to be: output_char = f(input_char, position, step_number)\n  * Often produces palindromic or symmetric patterns\n\nRULE 3: Terminal Extension\n- Input: 20-character output from Rule 2\n- Output: Extended sequence (20+ characters)\n- Mechanism: Appends variable-length suffix of repeated characters\n- Observations:\n  * Suffix length varies (1-10 characters observed)\n  * Repeated character often relates to last character of Rule 2 output\n  * No consistent formula for length determination observed\n\nRULE 4: Selective Position Modification\n- Input: Output from Rule 3\n- Output: Modified version with specific positions altered\n- Mechanism: Changes characters at 2-4 specific positions\n- Characteristics:\n  * Modified positions vary by step\n  * Changes appear non-random but pattern not fully determined\n  * Often affects early positions in the sequence\n  * May serve as preparation for final Rule 5 transformation\n\nRULE 5: Final Normalization\n- Input: Output from Rule 4\n- Output: Final transformed sequence\n- Mechanism: Sometimes applies additional modifications, sometimes leaves unchanged\n- When changes occur:\n  * Often converts multiple characters to same letter\n  * Creates more uniform or patterned sequences\n  * Appears to be cleanup/normalization step\n  * Not always applied (some steps show identical Rule 4 and Rule 5 outputs)\n\nSYSTEM PROPERTIES:\n1. All transformations are deterministic and consistent within each step\n2. Step number influences Rule 1 behavior and likely parameters for subsequent rules\n3. System uses extended alphabet beyond A-Z (observed up to Z and further)\n4. Rules build sequentially, each operating on output of previous rule\n5. Symmetry is a key theme, especially evident in Rule 2 mirroring\n6. Complexity increases through the rule chain from simple pairwise operations to complex transformations",

Ground truth requires taking the first 5 characters, combining them character-wise with the last main sequence by adding alphabet positions modulo 26, and appending the unchanged remainder.

The agent's description lacks the conditional logic based on primality and the frequency-based substitution, rendering it incorrect."
