    "judge_input": "Based on 50 steps of systematic testing and analysis, here is the complete mapping of transformation rules:\n\nRULE 1: INTERLEAVING WITH PARITY DEPENDENCE\n- Input: Two 5-character sequences (main and vice) using letters A-E\n- Transformation: Creates 10-character sequence by interleaving\n- Mechanism: \n  * On ODD step numbers: main at positions 1,3,5,7,9; vice at positions 2,4,6,8,10\n  * On EVEN step numbers: vice at positions 1,3,5,7,9; main at positions 2,4,6,8,10\n- Example (step 1): main=\"ABCDE\", vice=\"EDCBA\" \u2192 \"AEBDCCDBEA\"\n- Example (step 2): main=\"ABCDE\", vice=\"EDCBA\" \u2192 \"EADBCCBDAE\"\n\nRULE 2: PALINDROME CREATION WITH RELATIONSHIP-DEPENDENT TRANSFORMATION\n- Input: 10-character output from Rule 1\n- Transformation: Creates 20-character palindrome (first 10 chars + reverse)\n- Mechanism: First 10 characters transformed based on relationship between original main/vice:\n\nCase A: IDENTICAL SEQUENCES (main == vice)\n- Formula: new_value = ((step_number + 5) mod 26) - floor(i/2)\n  where i is 0-indexed position (0-9), values: A=1, B=2, ..., Z=26 (mod 26)\n- Creates symmetric pattern: values descend then ascend\n- Example (step 4): \"AABBCCDDEE\" \u2192 \"IIHHGGFFEEEEFFGGHHII\"\n\nCase B: REVERSE SEQUENCES (main == vice[::-1])\n- Formula: new_value = (old_value + step_number) mod 26\n- Simple modular addition\n- Example (step 1): \"AEBDCCDBEA\" \u2192 \"BFCEDDECFB...\"\n\nCase C: DIFFERENT SEQUENCES (all other cases)\n- Complex transformation involving both sequences\n- Not reducible to simple formula in testing\n- Appears to use combined information from both input sequences\n\nRULE 3: CHARACTER APPENDING\n- Adds characters to the end of Rule 2 output\n- Number and character vary\n- Often adds repeated characters, possibly based on frequency or position in sequence\n- Exact pattern not fully determined from testing\n\nRULES 4 & 5: SEQUENCE REFINEMENT\n- Modify selected letters in the sequence\n- Tend to increase repetition and symmetry\n- Create more uniform or patterned outputs\n- Exact transformation rules not fully determined\n\nGENERAL NOTES:\n- All transformations use modulo 26 arithmetic for letter values (A=1 to Z=26, wrap-around)\n- The system exhibits consistent behavior within each relationship category\n- \"Hard\" difficulty includes complex case handling in Rule 2 for different sequences\n- Rules 3-5 serve to further process and regularize the output",
