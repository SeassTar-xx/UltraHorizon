EXPLORATION PLAN:
1. Start with simple, systematic test cases to understand basic transformations
2. Test each rule's effect by varying one parameter at a time
3. Look for patterns in position-based transformations
4. Investigate relationships between main and vice sequences
5. Track transformation chains to understand rule dependencies
6. Build hypotheses and test them with targeted experiments
OBSERVATION 1:
Input: main="ABCDE", vice="EDCBA"
Rule 1 output: "AEBDCCDBEA" (10 chars)
Rule 2 output: "BFCEDDECFBBFCEDDECFB" (20 chars) - appears to be duplication with transformation
Rules 3-5: No change to sequence in this case

Patterns to investigate:
1. How does rule 1 combine main and vice?
2. What transformation does rule 2 apply?
3. When do rules 3-5 actually change sequences?
OBSERVATION 2:
Input: main="AABBC", vice="CCDDE"
Rule 1: "CACADBDBEC" (10 chars)
Rule 2: "EGDFDFCECEECECFDFDGE" (20 chars) - appears to be rule 1 output transformed and duplicated
Rule 3: "EGDFDFCECEECECFDFDGEGG" (22 chars) - adds "GG" at end
Rule 4: "EHFIHFCECEECECFDFDGEGG" - changes some letters
Rule 5: "FHFIHFCFCFFCFCFDFDGFGG" - more letter changes

Hypothesis: Rule 1 interleaves main and vice sequences somehow.
Let me check: main="AABBC", vice="CCDDE"
If I interleave: A C A C A D B D B E C? That gives "ACACADBDBEC" but rule 1 is "CACADBDBEC" - close but starts with C instead of A.
HYPOTHESIS FOR RULE 1:
From test cases:
1. main="ABCDE", vice="ABCDE" → "AABBCCDDEE" (main[i]+vice[i])
2. main="AABBC", vice="AABBC" → "AAAABBBBCC" (main[i]+vice[i])
3. main="ABCDE", vice="EDCBA" → "AEBDCCDBEA" (main[i]+vice[i]? Let's check: A+E=AE, B+D=BD, C+C=CC, D+B=DB, E+A=EA → "AEBDCCDBEA" ✓)
4. main="AABBC", vice="CCDDE" → "CACADBDBEC" (This doesn't match main[i]+vice[i] which would be "ACACBDBDCE")

Wait, maybe it's vice[i]+main[i] for case 4?
Position 1: C,A → "CA"
Position 2: C,A → "CA"
Position 3: D,B → "DB"
Position 4: D,B → "DB"
Position 5: E,C → "EC"
That gives "CACADBDBEC" ✓

So rule 1 might be: For each position i, output vice[i] + main[i]?
But test case 1 would then be "AABBCCDDEE" (same since main=vice)
Test case 2 would be "AAAABBBBCC" (same since main=vice)
Test case 3 would be: E,A + D,B + C,C + B,D + A,E = "EADBCCBDAE" but output is "AEBDCCDBEA"

So maybe it alternates? Or depends on something else?
CURRENT UNDERSTANDING:

Rule 1: Takes main and vice sequences (5 chars each), produces 10-char output.
Pattern not yet clear - seems to pair letters from each position but order varies.

Rule 2: Takes 10-char input, produces 20-char palindrome output.
Output = X + reverse(X) where X is 10-char transformation of input.
Transformation not yet understood.

Rule 3: Adds some characters at the end (extends length).
Rule 4: Changes some letters.
Rule 5: Changes more letters.

Need more systematic testing to understand rule 1. Let me test simple patterns to isolate variables.
COMPREHENSIVE TEST PLAN:

1. Test rule 1 systematically:
   - Cases where main and vice are identical
   - Cases where main < vice lexicographically
   - Cases where main > vice lexicographically
   - Cases with specific patterns (reverse, rotation, etc.)

2. Test rule 2: Need to understand the transformation from 10 chars to first half of 20-char palindrome

3. Test rule 3: What determines how many chars are added and which chars?

4. Test rules 4 and 5: Letter substitution patterns

Given time constraints, I should focus on discovering the exact mechanisms rather than exhaustive testing. The goal is to submit the complete mapping of rules to mechanisms.
