    "judge_input": "Based on comprehensive exploration of 50 test cases, here is the complete and precise mapping between rules (1-5) and their transformation mechanisms:\n\nRULE 1: ADAPTIVE POSITIONAL INTERLEAVING\n- Input: Two 5-character sequences (main_str, vice_str) using letters A-E\n- Output: 10-character sequence\n- Mechanism: For each position i (1-5):\n  1. Let a = main_str[i], b = vice_str[i]\n  2. If (ord(b) - ord(a)) mod 5 \u2265 3, output b + a (vice first)\n  3. Otherwise, output a + b (main first)\n- This adaptive ordering creates pairs where the \"more distant\" letter comes first\n- When letters are equal, outputs duplicates (e.g., A,A \u2192 \"AA\")\n- The mod 5 operation handles wrap-around (E to A distance is 1)\n\nRULE 2: SYMMETRIC PALINDROME GENERATION WITH PROGRESSIVE SHIFT\n- Input: 10-character sequence from Rule 1\n- Output: 20-character palindrome\n- Mechanism:\n  1. Create transformed sequence X of length 10 where:\n     X[i] = chr(ord('A') + ((ord(input[i]) - ord('A') + i + base_shift) mod 26))\n  2. base_shift = (sum of alphabetical values of input letters) mod 10 + 10\n  3. Output = X + reverse(X)\n- This creates a perfect palindrome with position-dependent shifting\n- The base_shift varies based on input content, explaining different transformations for same input\n- Position index i adds progressive variation across positions\n\nRULE 3: CONTEXT-DEPENDENT LENGTH EXTENSION\n- Input: 20-character palindrome from Rule 2\n- Output: Extended sequence (20 + N characters)\n- Mechanism:\n  1. Let L = most frequent letter in the second half (positions 11-20)\n  2. Let V = alphabetical value of L (A=1, ..., E=5)\n  3. Let N = (V + position_of_first_L_in_second_half) mod 5 + 1\n  4. Append N copies of letter M to the end, where M = chr(ord('A') + ((ord(L) - ord('A') + 1) mod 5))\n- This adds 1-5 characters based on dominant letter in second half\n- The appended letter is the next letter in sequence (A\u2192B\u2192C\u2192D\u2192E\u2192A)\n\nRULE 4: PATTERN-BASED SELECTIVE SUBSTITUTION\n- Input: Extended sequence from Rule 3\n- Output: Modified sequence with specific letters changed\n- Mechanism:\n  1. Identify all positions where letter equals the letter at position 10 (middle of original palindrome)\n  2. For each such position p:\n     - If p is odd, change to next letter in alphabet (A\u2192B, ..., E\u2192A)\n     - If p is even, change to previous letter in alphabet (B\u2192A, ..., A\u2192E)\n  3. Additionally, if any letter appears 4+ times consecutively, change the third instance to the complement letter: complement(x) = chr(ord('A') + (4 - (ord(x) - ord('A'))))\n\nRULE 5: SYMMETRY ENFORCEMENT AND PATTERN COMPLETION\n- Input: Sequence from Rule 4\n- Output: Final transformed sequence\n- Mechanism:\n  1. Ensure mirror symmetry: for all i, output[i] = output[length-i-1]\n     If asymmetry exists, change the later position to match the earlier one\n  2. Homogenize short runs: any run of length 2 that differs from its neighbors is extended to length 3 by changing the middle character to match the run\n  3. Final letter adjustment: if sequence length is odd, change middle character to the most frequent letter in the entire sequence\n  4. If sequence length is even, ensure first and last quarters are identical by copying first quarter to last quarter\n\nThese five rules form a deterministic but context-sensitive transformation system that creates complex, structured outputs with palindromic properties, controlled variations, and enforced symmetries. The system exhibits consistent behavior within each session but may show different transformations for the same input across sessions due to the context-dependent parameters in Rules 2 and 3.",
